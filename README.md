# NCCanadaGames
This is a school project created with the .NET core 3.1 MVC framework. It is a mock website to allow volunteers/employees of the Canada Summer Games to add Athletes, Sports, 
and Coaches to a database. Over the course of the semester, new concepts that will be taught will gradually be implemented to the project so that there is a fully functioning 
website :)
